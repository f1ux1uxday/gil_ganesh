        You do not control the creative process. </BR>
        The part of us which controls is not the part of us that creates.  </BR>
        Allow for chance, randomness, flexibility, and even imperfection.  </BR>
        These are the handmaidens of creation. Make yourself available to the forces. </BR> 
        Music is not for ego-satisfaction; that is a parasitic relationship.  </BR>
        An irresponsible use of power. A gardener cannot force a plant to grow.  </BR>
        He can merely produce the conditions in which plant growth is likely to occur. </BR>
        He leaves much to chance. Music is no different. Cultivate, sow and reap.  </BR>
        One cannot simply reap and find anything but a malnourished sort of Music.  </BR>
        It has none of the essential vitamins and minerals we all love,  </BR>
        and we are contracting AudioScurvy en masse.  </BR>
        Turn the soil and plenty healthy crops for next season.  </BR>
        Take a chance on no-control and receive aid from invisible partners. </BR> 
        Control-mind can only sacrifice impact for convention.  </BR>
        Create that which has a will to be born.</P>
