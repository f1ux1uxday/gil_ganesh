        Music is an aesthetic vehicle, it can be decorated any way one wishes,</BR> 
        yet blandness remains the aesthetic of choice and the vehicle remains stationary. </BR> 
        It rarely transports us and transforms our experience any more. </BR> 
        Music, rather, is expected to obey our experience. </BR> 
        We have chosen to not be transformed by music but instead </BR> 
        to have it in the background of a stale routine life that we insist must not change. </BR> 
        Do not give Genre People the idle music they demand! </BR> 
        Give them bold efforts and fresh aesthetics! </BR> 
        Music has played a role in many socio-political transformations, </BR> 
        turning tides in beautyâ€™s favor each time it combats the ugliness. </BR> 
        Freshness overcoming stale textures and rotten methods. </BR> 
        Do not send your vehicle on a meaningless voyage!</P>
