        Music reflects the external world. And that world has changed drastically. </BR>
        A fresh world demands a fresh aesthetic. </BR>
        Where there were woods and reeds there are now machines and cement. </BR>
        Musicians have to adjust accordingly. </BR>
        The music of today and tomorrow has very little use for yesterdayâ€™s sound.</BR>
         The past is certain, and certainty is easy. </BR>
         The present and future are fundamentally uncertain and difficult, </BR>
         so we prefer to live in the past. </BR>
         But the digital age is at hand!</BR>
         Artists can be pioneers only if they head out into those uncharted territories. </BR>
         Or they can become living museums of the retro-worship which always appears </BR>
         during the decline of a great civilization. </BR>
         Music is an infinite output machine. It can outlive you. </BR>
         Why endeavor to repeat the steps of other musicians and break no new ground? </BR>
         It will be as if you never participated at all, </BR>
         except in the slow blood-letting of a wonderful thing.
